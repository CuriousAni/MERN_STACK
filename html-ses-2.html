    <h2>Rinku Singh's blitzkrieg breaks several final-over records</h2>

        <p align="Right">Rinku Singh did the unthinkable as he hammered five sixes off five consecutive deliveries in the final over of the match to clinch an absolute thriller for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against defending champions Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match no. 13 of the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023. <br> A target of 205, KKR needed 29 off the last over and Rinku tonked Yash Dayal for five maximums to seal an epic and memorable victory for his side.</p>

        <p align="center">With this, KKR registered the highest target (29) achieved in the final over of an IPL innings. Yash registered an unwanted record of leaking the second-most runs (69) in an innings after Basil Thampi, who had conceded 0/70 (4) for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the 2018 edition. Rinku also recorded the most runs (30) scored by a player in the last over as he surpassed MS Dhoni, who slammed 24 against RCB in Bangalore in 2019.</p>
